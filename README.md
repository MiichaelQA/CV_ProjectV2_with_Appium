# Cv_Project_with_Appium

Hello, glad to see you here in the second part of my CV project!

This project will show you my knowledge in working with Selenium WebDriver, JIRA, Appium, Android Studio, Ui Automation, Genymotion, IntelliJ IDEA, Page Object and of course GitHub!

My full process of testing by tools listed above was shown in the GIF inside CV and here you can read my code and look how was the integration of reporting in TestRail and JIRA implemented
